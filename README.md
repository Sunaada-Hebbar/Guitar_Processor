# Project_Guitar_Processor
The objective of the project is to develop a microprocessor(Odroid C2) based system which takes input from an electric guitar (analog audio signals), pre amplifies it and applies antialias filter  and  it is given as input Odroid C2 ADC pins. DSP filters/algorithms are applied through software application running on Odroid C2 to provide various audio effects (produced by typical guitar processor in the market) and the output digital signal is converted back to analog which can be fed to a guitar amplifier.
