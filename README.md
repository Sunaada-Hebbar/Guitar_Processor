The objective of the project is to develop a microprocessor(Odroid C2) based system which has an initial analog circuit stage that takes input from an electric guitar (analog audio signals), pre amplifies it and applies antialias filter and then the processed signal is given as input to Odroid C2 ADC. The digital signals received are passed through various DSP filters/algorithms through a software application running on Odroid C2 to provide various audio effects (produced by typical guitar processor in the market) and the output digital signal is converted back to the analog signal by a final output stage which can be fed to a guitar amplifier.
